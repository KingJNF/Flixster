### Notes

Slight difficulty when trying to pull the correct rating. Resolved easily by importing the Movie class. Part 2 was alot easier and shorter overall than Part 1. At least the required stories.Also had an issue when trying to use app on anything not running on API 29. Fixed by using an intent query.

   - [x] (1pt) In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - [ ] (1pt) In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout should use the backdrop image instead and show the title and movie overview to the right of it.

- [ ] (2pts) Improved the user interface by experimenting with styling and coloring.
- [ ] (2pts) For popular movies (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars), the full backdrop image is displayed. Otherwise, a poster image, the movie title, and overview is listed. Use Heterogenous RecyclerViews and use different ViewHolder layout files for popular movies and less popular ones.

### Notes
One line of code that was thankfully fixed by a CodePath TA allowed me to get past the major hurdle. I was able to pull the application onto a physical device and emulator with no apparent error but the app was appearing blank. Upon providing me a correct line of code the app ran without issue.
